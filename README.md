# OAuth1 PHP
[Andy Smith](http://term.ie/)'s basic php library for OAuth. Original code taken from google code. For reference (and since google code is going away), I have ported the entire project to github. [You can find it here](https://github.com/jtsternberg/oauth).

To use this, be sure to run `composer install` in the root of the lib.

I have also split out the spec portion of the google code repo to [its own repo](https://github.com/jtsternberg/oauth-spec).
