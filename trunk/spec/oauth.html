<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>The OAuth protocol enables interaction between a Web Service Provider(SP) and
Consumer website or application. An example use case would be allowing Moo.com,
the OAuth Consumer, to access private photos stored on Flickr.com, the OAuth
Service Provider. This allows access to protected resources (Protected
Resources) via an API without requiring the User to provide their Flickr.com
(Service Provider) credentials to Moo.com (Consumer). More generically,
OAuth creates a freely implementable and generic methodology for API
authentication creating benefit to developers wishing to have their Consumer
interact with various Service Providers.</p>

<p>While OAuth does not require a certain form of user interface or interaction
with a User, recommendations and emerging best practices are described
below. OAuth does not specify how the Service Provider should authenticate
the User which makes the protocol ideal in cases where authentication
credentials are not available to the Consumer, such as with OpenID. 
Background</p>

<p>OAuth aims to unify the experience and implementation of delegated web service
authentication into a single community driven protocol. OAuth builds on top of
existing protocols and best practices that have been implemented independently
by various web sites. An open standard supported by large and small providers
alike promotes a consistent and trusted experience for both consumer
application developers and the users of those applications. </p>

<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Service Provider
: A web application that allows access via OAuth. </li>
<li>User
: An individual user who has an account with the Service Provider. </li>
<li>Consumer
: A website or application that uses OAuth to access the Service Provider on
behalf of the User. </li>
<li>Consumer Developer
: An individual or organization that implements a Consumer. </li>
<li>Consumer Key
: A string which the Consumer uses to identify itself to the Service Provider. </li>

OAuth requests to the Service Provider.</li>
<li>Protected Resource(s)
: Data owned by the Service Provider for which the Consumer could obtain access
through authentication.</li>
<li>Single-Use Token

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<h4 id="pre_authentication">Pre-Authentication</h4>

<ol>
<li>The Consumer Developer obtains a Consumer Key and a Consumer Secret from
the Service Provider.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>

<ol>
<li>The Consumer attempts to obtain a Multi-Use Token and Secret on behalf of
the end user. 
<ul>
<li>Web-based Consumers redirect the User to the Authorization Endpoint URL. </li>
<li>Desktop-based Consumers first obtain a Single-Use Token by making a
request to the API Endpoint URL then direct the User to the Authorization
Endpoint URL.</li>
<li>UI Note: If a Service Provider is expecting a Consumer running on a mobile
device or set top box, the Service Provider should ensure that the
Authorization Endpoint URL and the Single Use Token are short and simple
enough to remember for entry into a web browser.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The User authenticates with the Service Provider. </li>
<li>The User grants or declines permission for the Service Provider to give the
Consumer a Multi-Use Token. </li>
<li>The Service Provider authorizes the Single-Use Token and Secret to be
exchanged for a Multi-Use Token and Secret.
<ul>
<li>Note that in the case of a Web or Mobile based consumer the
Single-Use Token and Secret will be generated by the Service Provider
during this step.</li>
<li>For web-based Consumers the Service Provider redirects to a
pre-established Callback Endpoint URL with the Single-Use Token
and Secret it has created and authorized.</li>
<li>For Mobile and Set Top box Consumers the Service Provider displays
the Single-Use Token and Secret to the User and the Consumer waits
for the User to manually enter them within the Consumer application.</li>
<li>For Desktop-based Consumers the Service Provider instructs the User
to inform the Consumer that authorization has completed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Consumer exchanges the Single-Use Token and Secret for a Multi-User
Token and Secret.</li>
<li>The Consumer uses the Multi-Use Token, Multi-Use Secret, Consumer Key, and
Consumer Secret to make authenticated requests to the Service Provider. </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="obtaining_a_consumer_key">Obtaining a Consumer Key</h4>

<p>OAuth includes a Consumer Key and matching Consumer Secret allowing the Service
Provider to authenticate the Consumer (as opposed to authenticate the User).
This allows the Service Provider to provide different access levels to
Consumers (such as disabling API throttling or allowing access to more
resources).The Service Provider must allow Consumer Developers to obtain a
Consumer Key and corresponding Consumer Secret. The provisioning of these is
entirely up to the Service Provider. The Consumer Key must be a string
suitable for transmission in HTTP request parameters. The Consumer Secret may
be either a randomized string or a Public/Private Key Pair. In the case that
the Consumer Secret is a Public/Private Key Pair, the Service Provider only
requires the Public Key, and should verify that the Consumer Developer is in
fact the owner of the Private Key. </p>

<p>The Service Provider must also provide documentation detailing the following: </p>

<ol>
<li>The Endpoint URLs that the Consumer will use when making OAuth requests; 
<ul>
<li>Authorization Endpoint URL </li>
<li>API Endpoint URLs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Signature Algorithms supported by the Service Provider. See &#8220;Recommended
Signature Algorithms&#8221; for a summary of best practices. </li>
<li>Any additional request parameters that the Service Provider requires in
order to obtain a Token.</li>
</ol>

<p>When registering for a Consumer Key, the Service Provider asks the Consumer
Developer for information regarding the nature of the Consumer (web
application, desktop application, mobile application etc). If the Consumer is a
web application, the Consumer Developer must provide the callback URL where the
Service Provider will send the OAuth Tokens. Libraries implementing OAuth for
the convenience of Consumer applications must support configurable API Endpoint
URLs. </p>

<h4 id="obtaining_a_single_use_token">Obtaining a Single-Use Token</h4>

<p>UI Note: It should be noted that if the User will be entering the Single-Use
Token manually, such as on a mobile device, you should create a shorter
&#8220;simplified&#8221; token.</p>

<h4 id="web_based_consumers">Web-based Consumers</h4>

<p>Web-based Consumers obtain the Single-Use Token by way of an HTTP Redirect from
the Service Provider to the Consumer&#8217;s Callback Endpoint URL. The
request/response cycle is as follows:</p>

<h5 id="consumer_requests_an_authorized_single_use_token">Consumer Requests An Authorized Single-Use Token</h5>

<p>To request a Single-Use Token, the Consumer constructs an
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> HTTP GET request to the Service Provider&#8217;s
Authorization Endpoint URL which will be sent via the end user&#8217;s user-agent
(i.e., Web Browser).</p>

<h6 id="request">Request</h6>

<p>This request contains the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>oauth_consumer_key</code> - The Consumer Key </li>
<li><code>oauth_state</code> (optional) - An <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> string that
will be passed through unmodified to the Consumer (this parameter should only
be used in the case of stateless web-based Consumers) </li>
<li>any additional parameters, as required by the Service Provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the request URL has been generated the Consumer issues an HTTP 302
Redirect to the Service Provider using that URL.</p>

<h6 id="example">Example</h6>

<p>In this example, the Consumer is requesting a Single-Use Token from the
Authorization Endpoint URL <code>https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize</code>
with the Consumer Key <code>0685bd91</code>. </p>

<pre><code>https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_consumer_key=0685bd91
</code></pre>

<h5 id="service_provider_obtains_user_consent">Service Provider Obtains User Consent</h5>

<p>Once the user has been authenticated by the Service Provider, the Service
Provider must present the user with the option to grant access to the Consumer.
The Service Provider should specify to the user which Protected Resources the
Client is requesting, for how long the Client will have access to the
resources, and other important information about the authorization that will be
granted to the Client. If the user grants permission, the Service Provider
should retain information about the transaction, including the token,
associated user and Client data, the Requested Resources, time limits, etc. If
the user denies the Client access, the Service Provider will not provide the
Protected Resources to the Client.</p>

<pre><code>Proposed UI? Too many protocols just leave user interaction as a hand-wavy
step. It would be great to at least provide best practices and/or sample
mock-ups. - Rich Conlan, 08/14/07 8:27 AM
</code></pre>

<h5 id="service_provider_responds_with_authorized_single_use_token_and_secret">Service Provider Responds With Authorized Single-Use Token and Secret</h5>

<p>Assuming permission is granted, the Service Provider will create a Single-Use
Token and Single-Use Token Secret and deliver it to the Consumer via an HTTP
Redirect.</p>

<h6 id="response">Response</h6>

<p>The response for a Web-based Consumer includes the following
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> GET parameters: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>oauth_token</code> - The Single-Use Token. </li>
<li><code>oauth_secret</code> - The Single-Use Token Secret. </li>
<li><code>oauth_state</code> (if provided in request) - The unmodified content provided by
the Consumer during the Request step.</li>
</ul>

<h6 id="example">Example</h6>

<p>In this example, the Service Provider has created a Single-Use Token
<code>c3e347b6a5001c16</code> and Secret <code>678dfge7dghek243</code> for the Consumer whose
Callback Endpoint URL is <code>https://consumer.example.com/validate</code>, so
the Service Provider will redirect the User to the following URL: </p>

<pre><code>https://consumer.example.com/validate?oauth_token=c3e347b6a5001c16&amp;oath_token_secret=678dfge7dghek243
</code></pre>

<h4 id="desktop_consumers">Desktop Consumers</h4>

<p>Desktop consumers MUST first obtain a Single-Use Token, since they aren&#8217;t
able to provide a Callback URL to which the Service Provider redirects the
User. This is done by making a request to the appropriate Service Provider&#8217;s
API Endpoint URL.</p>

<h5 id="request_single_use_token">Request Single-Use Token</h5>

<p>To request a Single-Use Token, the consumer constructs a request to the
Service Provider&#8217;s API Endpoint URL. The request is signed as described in
&#8220;Signing an API Request&#8221;. Because the Consumer does not yet have a Token or
Token Secret, these fields are left empty.</p>

<p>Assuming the request is properly signed and accepted by the Service Provider,
the Service Provider then returns the Single-Use Token and a Single-Use
Authentication Secret in the body of the response as newline separated
name-value pairs, followed by any additional data the Service Provider wishes
to provide.</p>

<h6 id="example">Example</h6>

<p>In this example, the Consumer has a Consumer Key <code>1b20acc6</code> and a
Consumer Secret <code>427a5979d9df7722</code>. The Service Provider&#8217;s API Endpoint URL
for requesting a Single-Use Token is
<code>http://sp.example.com/oauth/get_su_token</code>, and the request is using the
HTTP GET method. The nonce is <code>17907867114999140772853922434221488511</code> and
the timestamp of <code>1186953553</code>. Using SHA1 as the signing algorithm, the
signature is then <code>26287279e66f7f183af02653e823625871167d16</code>, and the request
is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>https://sp.example.com/oauth/get_su_token?oauth_consumer_key=1b20acc6&amp;oauth_nonce=17907867114999140772853922434221488511&amp;oauth_ts=1186953553&amp;oauth_sigalg=sha1&amp;oauth_sig=26287279e66f7f183af02653e823625871167d16
</code></pre>

<p>The Service Provider generates a Single-Use Token <code>37bb49b4</code> and a
corresponding secret <code>d0e46c19</code>, and returns the following as the body of the
response:</p>

<pre><code>token=37bb49b4
secret=d0e46c19
</code></pre>

<h5 id="direct_user_to_service_provider">Direct User to Service Provider</h5>

<p>To exchange a Single-Use Token for a Multi-Use Token and Secret, the Consumer
must obtain approval from the User by directing the User to the Service
Provider. The Consumer constructs an <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>
HTTP GET request to the Service Provider&#8217;s Authorization Endpoint URL which
will be sent via the end user&#8217;s user-agent (i.e., Web Browser).</p>

<h6 id="request">Request</h6>

<p>This request contains the following parameters: </p>

<ul>
<li><code>oauth_consumer_key</code>
: The Consumer Key </li>
<li><code>oauth_token</code>
: The Single-Use Token obtained in the previous step.</li>
<li><code>oauth_state</code> (optional)
: An <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> string that will be passed through
unmodified to the Consumer (this parameter should only be used in the case of
stateless web-based Consumers) </li>
<li>any additional parameters, as required by the Service Provider.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the request URL has been generated the Consumer directs the User to the
URL.</p>

<h6 id="example">Example</h6>

<p>In this example, the Consumer is requesting a Single-Use Token and Secret from
the Service Provider&#8217;s Authorization Endpoint URL
<code>https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize</code> with the Consumer Key <code>0685bd91</code> and
Single-Use Token <code>37bb49b4</code>.</p>

<pre><code>https://sp.example.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_consumer_key=0685bd91&amp;oauth_token=37bb49b4
</code></pre>

<h5 id="service_provider_obtains_user_consent">Service Provider Obtains User Consent</h5>

<p>The Service Provider Obtains User Consent in the same manner and with the same
requirements as for Web-based Consumers.</p>

<h6 id="response">Response</h6>

<p>Assuming permission is granted, the Service Provider will instruct the User
to inform the Consumer that authorization has completed at the appropriate
prompt within the Consumer application.</p>

<h5 id="obtaining_a_multi_use_token">Obtaining a Multi-Use Token</h5>

<p>Once the Single-Use Token and Secret have been authorized, the Consumer can
exchange them for a Multi-Use Token and Secret.</p>

<h6 id="request">Request</h6>

<p>To request a Multi-Use Token, the Consumer makes an HTTP request to an Endpoint
for Token Exchange as specified by the Service Provider&#8217;s documentation. It is
suggested that this is a POST request, and that the Service Provider&#8217;s
documentation specifies the HTTP verb (GET or POST). The request MUST be signed
with the Single-Use Token and Secret per the signing instructions below.</p>

<h6 id="response">Response</h6>

<p>If the request is valid, the Service Provider responds with text like so: </p>

<pre><code>token=37bb49b4
secret=d0e46c19
</code></pre>

<p>where the token and secret are encoded like <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>,
followed by Service Provider specific data, as defined by the Service Provider&#8217;s
API documentation. The Multi-Use Token and Secret are stored by the Consumer to
use when signing future requests. </p>

<p>If the request is not successful, the Service Provider MUST respond with a HTTP
401 Not Authorized, and MAY include some further details about why the request
wasn&#8217;t authorized.</p>

<h4 id="signing_an_api_request">Signing an API Request</h4>

<p>All OAuth API requests MUST be signed by the Consumer and the signature verified
by the Service Provider. The following steps describe the signature process: </p>

<h5 id="request_parameters">Request Parameters</h5>

<p>All are required except where stated.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>oauth_consumer_key</code>
: An API key. This is an arbitrary Consumer application specific identifier. </li>
<li><code>oauth_secret</code>
: The Secret that corresponds to the Consumer key. </li>
<li><code>oauth_token</code>
: An OAuth token. See the &#8220;Obtaining a Token&#8221; sections. </li>
<li><code>oauth_token_secret</code>
: An OAuth token secret. See the &#8220;Obtaining a Token&#8221; sections.</li>
<li><code>oauth_nonce</code>
: A one-time use value to verify the request has not been made before. See the
&#8220;Generating Nonces&#8221; section. </li>
<li><code>oauth_ts</code>
: An integer representing the time the request was sent, expressed in number of
seconds after January 1, 1970 00:00:00 GMT. </li>
<li><code>oauth_sigalg</code>
: The hashing algorithm that the Consumer used to sign the request. </li>
<li><code>oauth_sig</code>
: The signature. </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="format_of_request_parameters">Format of Request Parameters</h5>

<p>The request parameters must be concatenated in the following order:</p>

<pre><code>oauth_secret, oauth_consumer_key, oauth_token, oath_token_secret,
http_request_method, http_request_uri, normalized_request_parameters,
oauth_nonce, oauth_ts
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, any application specific parameters MUST be included in the
Consumer&#8217;s Request and are the subject of the signature. </p>

<p>After the Consumer has normalized the request parameters (see below), the
following signing algorithm SHALL be used to generate the value of the
<code>oauth_sig</code>: </p>

<ul>
<li>obtain the normalized<em>request</em>parameters, according to the algorithm
described below (see: Normalizing Request Parameters)</li>
<li>generate an oauth_nonce (see Generating Nonces) </li>
<li><p>concatenate the parameters in the following order: </p>

<p>oauth<em>secret, oauth</em>consumer<em>key, oauth</em>token, http<em>request</em>method,
http<em>request</em>uri, normalized<em>request</em>parameters, oauth<em>nonce, oauth</em>ts </p></li>
<li><p>sign or hash the concatenated string according to the oauth_sigalg: </p>

<p>oauth<em>sig = md5(concatenated</em>string) </p>

<p>oauth<em>sig = sha1(concatenated</em>string) </p>

<p>oauth<em>sig = hmac</em>sha256(oauth<em>secret, concatenated</em>string)</p>

<p>oauth<em>sig = openssl</em>x509<em>sign(private</em>certificate, concatenated_string)
(in the case of using x509 certs, the Service Provider would have the
Consumer&#8217;s public key and therefore would provide an empty string as
the secret)</p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<ol>
<li>Fetch the 3rd page of friends updates from Twitter for user 123456</li>
<li><p>The basic API request looks like so:</p>

<p>http://twitter.com/statuses/with_friends/123456.json?page=3&amp;count=50</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming your Consumer key is <code>0685bd91</code>, your Shared Secret is <code>3a2cd35</code>,
and your OAuth Token is <code>540ad18</code>, your generated <code>oauth_nonce</code> is
<code>MTgzNTYxODk4Mw</code>, the current <code>timestamp</code> is <code>1185517832</code>, and you are using
SHA1 as your <code>oauth_sigalg</code>, we calculate the <code>oauth_sig</code> as:</p>

<p>oauth_sig = SHA1(&#8220;3a2cd35 0685bd91 540ad18 GET /statuses/friends/123456.json count50page3 MTgzNTYxODk4Mw 1185517832&#8221;)</p></li>
<li><p>We need to pass to the server (in cleartext) the Consumer key (<code>oauth_key</code>),
the Token (<code>oauth_token</code>), the timestamp (<code>oauth_ts</code>), the nonce
(<code>oauth_nonce</code>), the signing algorithm (oauth_sigalg), and the signed
request (<code>oauth_sig</code>).
Clients MUST NOT send the shared secret with the request, since doing so
would compromise the entire request, as well as subsequent requests.</p></li>
<li><p>The full signed request is then:</p>

<p>GET http://twitter.com/statuses/friends/123456.json?page=3&amp;count=50&amp;oauth<em>key=0685bd91&amp;oauth</em>token=540ad18&amp;oauth<em>nonce=MTgzNTYxODk4Mw&amp;oauth</em>ts=1181537927&amp;oauth<em>sigalg=sha1&amp;oauth</em>sig=7f762ca98931f60715c5452b09a9b56914d68568</p>

<p>XXX It feels like this ends early. What does twitter do? I assume it
validates the signature, of course, but shouldn&#8217;t the protocol for that be
spelled out? - Rich Conlan, 08/14/07 8:27 AM</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="normalizing_request_parameters">Normalizing Request Parameters</h3>

<p>The Consumer MUST first normalize the request parameters by following the
steps below. It should be noted that the Consumer MUST NOT include any OAuth
parameters, those beginning with &#8220;oauth&#8221;, in the data to be signed . The
normalized string MUST then be used when generating the signature for a
request. </p>

<ol>
<li>Sort the request parameters alphabetically by parameter name:
e.g., page=3, count=50 becomes count=50, page=3</li>
<li>Concatenate the name-value pairs:
e.g., count50 and page3</li>
<li>Concatenate all the resulting parameter strings:
e.g., count50page3</li>
</ol>

<p>The encoding and format of the parameters and their values MUST not be changed
during this process as the Service Provider will perform this same set of steps
when verifying the signature.</p>

<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>

<h6 id="ruby">Ruby</h6>

<p>Assuming a Hash of request parameters named <code>request_params</code>:</p>

<pre><code>request_params.sort { |a,b| a[0].to_s &lt;=&gt; b[0].to_s }.map { |v| v.join('') }.join('')
</code></pre>

<h6 id="php">PHP</h6>

<p>Assuming an Array of request parameters named <code>$request_params</code>:</p>

<pre><code>normalized = ''
keys = request_params.keys()
keys.sort()
for k in keys:
  normalized += str(k)+str(request_params[k])
</code></pre>

<h3 id="generating_nonces">Generating Nonces</h3>

<p>A nonce is a random string, uniquely generated for each request. The nonce
allows the Service Provider to verify that this request has never been made
before and helps prevent against replay attacks. More information about nonces
can be found on Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce).</p>

<h3 id="implementation_suggestions">Implementation Suggestions</h3>

<p>Timestamps should be good for 5 minutes, this gives sufficient time to deal
with network latency, without becoming a security hole, or placing an
unbearable burden on the server for tracking and storing nonces. Ideally
servers would provide a method for retrieving what they think the current time
is.</p>
